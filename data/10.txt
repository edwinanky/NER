Djarot welcomes songs for Ahok and unity
Acting governor Djarot Saiful Hidayat voiced appreciation to hundreds of people gathered early Wednesday in front of City Hall in support of non-active governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, who has been sentenced to two years in prison for blasphemy.

He thanked the supporters, who arrived at City Hall at 6 a.m. Wednesday and spontaneously formed a choir to be led in song by noted conductor Addie MS.

Ahok’s running mate in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election, which the pair lost to Anies Baswedan and Sandiaga Uno, also prompted the public to unite to show support for the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI) and Ahok.

 “Peace for all Jakartans and Indonesians. I sincerely ask all who love Pak Ahok to walk hand in hand peacefully, without violence,” Djarot said in a short speech.

“Please set a good example to others that Indonesia has Pancasila as its ideology and the motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika  [unity in diversity].”

Addie said the songs performed were dedicated to Ahok and the unity of the country.

The choir enthusiastically sang the songs from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. in front of City Hall.
