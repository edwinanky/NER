Parties supporting Ahok call on public to respect court ruling
While the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) has openly criticized the court ruling against Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, other political parties that back the incumbent Jakarta governor have taken a softer stance.

The Hanura Party, which backed Ahok in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election along with the PDI-P, Golkar and NasDem parties, said everyone must respect the verdict and that Ahok should exercise patience in the matter.

"The judges' decision must have strong a legal basis and can be accounted for," Hanura deputy secretary-general Dadang Rusdiana said on Wednesday as quoted by tribunnews.com.

The North Jakarta District Court ruled on Tuesday that Ahok was guilty of blasphemy and sentenced him two years in prison.

Many legal experts and human rights activists have lambasted the verdict, saying it was irregular and based on the draconian Blasphemy Law.

Meanwhile, NasDem executive Taufiqulhadi said people should trust the court.

"I have no comment. I trust the court. But to seek more fairness, Ahok can appeal. That's his right as a justice seeker," he said.

Meanwhile, PDI-P politician Eva Kusuma Sundari said the verdict was an expression of hatred, not justice.

"The judges used their 'independence' to punish Ahok beyond the prosecutors' demand. And it's a setback in our democracy, because they sacrificed justice," Eva said.

She added that it a bad precedent that tarnished the country's image.
