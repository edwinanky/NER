Ahok detained for blasphemy, police continue probe into FPI officials
Following the guilty ruling in non-active Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama’s blasphemy case, questions linger over the fate of similar cases implicating the top officials of the hard-line Islam Defenders Front (FPI).

FPI leader Rizieq Shihab was reported by the Indonesian Catholic Students Association (PMKRI) and Students Peace Institute (SPI) to the Jakarta Police in December after a video of a sermon he gave was uploaded onto Twitter and Instagram. In the 22-second video, Rizieq is heard saying: “If God gave birth, then who would be the midwife?”

Meanwhile, his confidante, FPI spokesman Munarman, was named a suspect in February by Bali Police for allegedly insulting pecalang (traditional Balinese security guards).

National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Rikwanto said investigations into both cases were ongoing. He denied Ahok’s case had been given extra attention.

“Everyone is equal before the law,” he told journalists at the National Police headquarters on Tuesday.

Ahok was declared guilty for blasphemy and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment by a panel of judges at the North Jakarta District Court on Tuesday. Upon the handing down of the ruling, he was suspended by the Home Ministry and his deputy governor was appointed acting governor.
